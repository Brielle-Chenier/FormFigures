# Travelfy

Travelfy is an that will let you create playlists for coutnries aroudn the world!

You can pick a coutnry using the search or the map locted at hte bottom of the website. Playlists are made using Spotify's API and spotipy. When using the map, we used Google Maps API to read the latitude and longitude and Google Maps Geocoder AOI to get country name based on that information.

To run our app, download the flaskApp folder and run page1.py. You may need to install flask and spotify first.
